- But who knows what he 'll think tomorrow ?
- In case you haven 't noticed , he is a very haphazard individual .
- Hm . If he doesn 't break the case soon ? Exactly . He starts looking for a scapegoat because the pressure 's building and Edna 's the most obvious candidate .
- Well , what should we do ?
- Protect her . Rudy would 've wanted us to look out for her interests . She trusts you , Frank . Get her here . Talk to her like a Dutch uncle . Fill her in on the situation .
- You 're sure we should allow her house to be searched ?
- Absolutely . You ought to recommend we insist on it . That way , we get it on the record that nothing 's been found to incriminate her .
- All right . Miss Henderson , get me Mrs Mathews .
- Oh , she 's shopping at the Fashion Center in Beverly Hills . You can bring her in here right now and clarify this whole thing . Miss Henderson , have her paged at the Fashion Center . We 'll clear it up today .
- Well , there may be one small hitch to that . Columbo refuses to search the house . He claims it 'd be a waste of time . Oh ?
- Which merely perpetuates Edna 's anxiety . I wish there was something we could do about that man , Frank .
- Well , perhaps there 's some way around him .
- You really think so ?
- I have a few friends at City Hall . Let me look into it .
- Fine . Thank you . I 'll just run one errand and I 'll be right back .
- Fine . Fine . Miss Henderson , after I talk to Mrs Mathews , I want the police department .
- Dale ?
- Edna does have an excellent motive .
- You don 't think there 's any chance ... ?
- Of course not . You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
- Yeah . Sorry ."

- Of course , of course slavery Is the worst thing that ever happened . Of course it is , every time it 's happened- Black people in america , jews in egypt . Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved , It 's a terrible , horrible thing , of course ... But maybe ... Maybe every incredible human achievement in history Was done with slaves . Every single thing where you go , how did they build those pyramids ?
- They just threw human death and suffering at them Until they were finished .
- How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly ?
- We just threw chinese people in caves and blew ' em up And didn 't give a shit what happened to them . There 's no end to what you can do When you don 't give a fuck about particular people . You can do anything .
- That 's where human greatness comes from , Is that we 're shitty people , that we fuck others over .
- Even today , how do we have this amazing microtechnology ?
- Because the factory where they 're making these , They jump off the fucking roof 'cause it 's a nightmare in there . You really have a choice . You can have candles and horses And be a little kinder to each other Or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube While you 're taking a shit .
